# DigitRecognition
This project implements a Digit Recognition System using machine learning techniques. The primary goal is to recognize handwritten digits (0-9) from image data, such as the widely used MNIST dataset. The system is trained to accurately predict the digit present in an image by processing pixel values.
Features
**Image Preprocessing:**

Converts raw image data into a format suitable for machine learning models.

**Model Training:**

Uses various machine learning models, such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or Neural Networks, to train the system on digit recognition.

**Accuracy Evaluation:**

Evaluates model performance using accuracy metrics on training and test datasets.
User-Friendly Interface: Includes a basic interface where users can input handwritten digits and receive predictions.

**Project Components**


**Dataset:** Uses the MNIST dataset, which contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits.

**Model Training:** Machine learning algorithms are applied to train models for digit classification.

**Model Evaluation:** The system measures accuracy and performance through confusion matrices, accuracy scores, and loss functions.

**Prediction Interface:** Provides an interface to test the model with custom input images.


**Applications**


Handwritten digit recognition in real-time.
Digit identification in scanned documents or forms.
Educational tools for learning machine learning concepts.
